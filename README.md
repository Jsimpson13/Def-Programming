# Def-Programming
Defensive Programming Class Project
The course project will be done in teams of 2 or 3. There are two main parts to the project as detailed below. All team members are expected to work on both parts of the project.

Part 1: Design and development of  the program
Description: The purpose of the program is to create a ticket purchasing program that allows for users to log in, purchase tickets, keep records of tickets purchased, and keep information about the user. 

Program Requirements: The following are the program requirements:

Must be fully functioning including registration, log-in, view events, and purchase tickets

Tickets should be purchased using “points”, no information should be provided via the user for payment method. Default each user to an allotted number of points and have a way to add to the points from the menu.

Must include a user interface for the user to interact with. It should be clearly and easily navigated.

The program should be clearly commented and documented.

The program should be written in Python and  use a client-server configuration. It should run  in the SEED Ubuntu machine we use for class. Data for the users should be kept on the server either in flat files or a SQLite database. The client program should request the data from the server.

At least 2 vulnerabilities must be left in the program. The vulnerabilities should be documented in private documentation. All other vulnerabilities should be considered and mitigated.

A detailed user guide should be prepared for the program (not to replace the code documentation).

Deliverables:

All program code with documentation (client and server code and any additional files used).
User guide with clear descriptions of how to run and navigate the program.
Documentation of (intentional) vulnerabilities left out in the program.
Part 1 Due Date: All deliverables above are due by  Friday, April 18 2025@ 10:00 PM.  Failure to submit on time will prevent your team from completing Part 2 of the assignment and will cause the team to fail the project.

Part 2: Finding Vulnerabilities in Other Projects
Description: Once the programs are submitted, each team will be randomly assigned another team's program to test for vulnerabilities and present the found vulnerabilities to the class. This is the importance of not telling others the vulnerabilities used. You will not find out which team's program you are evaluating until April 22.

Deliverables: 

A write-up detailing the methods used to find the vulnerabilities and results of each tests (including failed attempts). This should include code snippets used. 
A presentation  demonstrating how the program you are testing is working and the vulnerabilities you have found.
Part 2 Due Date: 

Write-up due on May 1 @ 10:00 PM.
Presentation  slides due on May 1 @ 10:00 PM.
Presentations will take place on Friday, May 2 from 1:30 to 3:30pm  in SCCT 405 (during our scheduled final exam time)

Rubric:

Planning document and progress reports -- 12%
Part 1 Total -- 60%
Meets requirements and well documented with a user guide -- 40%

User Manual 10%

Documentation of the two vulnerabilities left in the program --10%
Part 2 Total -- 25%
Overall presentation (including the demonstration) --  15% 
Presentation of the two vulnerabilities (including the demonstration) --10%
                 NOTE: Any additional well-presented vulnerability will  earn 3 extra credits for the team. It will also cause the other team to lose 3 credits. 

Group Evaluation - 3%
